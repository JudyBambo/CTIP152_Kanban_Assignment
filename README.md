# CTIP152 Kanban Task Management System

## Overview
This project is a **Basic Kanban Task Management System** developed in **Python** as part of the CTIP152 (Computational Thinking and Intro to Programming) SS3 assignment at STADIO.  

The system allows users to:

- Register and log in with a validated username and password
- Add, categorize, and manage tasks (To-Do, Doing, Done)
- Generate task reports
- Search tasks by task name or developer
- Find the task with the longest duration
- Delete tasks
- Calculate the total duration of all tasks

This project demonstrates **computational thinking**, **Python programming constructs**, and **data processing using lists and dictionaries**.
